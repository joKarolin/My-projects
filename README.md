Welcome to the Security Tools Repository! 
This repository contains three distinct security-related projects: a Password Generator Tool, a Text Encryption Tool, and a Keylogger. Each project is implemented using Python and includes a web interface for user interaction, except for the Keylogger, which operates in the background.

Description: The Password Generator Tool generates secure, random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length and character types (e.g., letters, numbers, special characters). The tool also includes a password strength indicator to help users create strong passwords.

Features:
Generate passwords of customizable length.
Include or exclude letters, numbers, and special characters.
Password strength indicator.

Technology:
Backend: Python 3,
Frontend: HTML,
Integration: Flask


Text Encryption Tool:
Description:
The Text Encryption Tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a combination of Caesar cipher and Vigenere cipher. This tool provides an extra layer of security by combining two encryption methods.

Features:
Encrypt and decrypt text using Caesar cipher and Vigenere cipher.
Handle case sensitivity in the encryption and decryption processes.
User-friendly interface.

Technology:
Backend: Python 3,
Frontend: HTML,
Integration: Flask


Keylogger:
Description:
The Keylogger is a background tool that records keystrokes on a device and stores them in a text file. It is designed to run invisibly without a user interface.

Features:
Record all keystrokes on the device.
Store keystrokes in a text file.
Operate invisibly in the background.
